# ðŸŒŠ Sea Level Predictor

This project is part of the [freeCodeCamp Data Analysis with Python Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-analysis-with-python/).

## ðŸ“Œ Project Description

The goal of this project is to analyze historical data on global average sea levels and create predictions through the year 2050 using linear regression models.

You will visualize the data using a scatter plot and draw two lines of best fit:
- One using all available data (1880â€“2013)
- One using data from the year 2000 onward

## ðŸ“Š Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- SciPy (for linear regression)

## ðŸ§ª How to Run

1. Make sure you have the required libraries installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib scipy
